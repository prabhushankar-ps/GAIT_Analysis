# README: Gait Recognition Using Biometric Technology

## Overview

This study focuses on the use of **gait recognition** as a biometric technology to identify individuals based on their unique walking patterns. Gait analysis provides a **non-invasive** method for human recognition, even from **long distances** and under **low-resolution conditions**. The proposed approach includes the development of a novel **SSFE algorithm** for efficient silhouette extraction and feature quantification, enhancing the accuracy and performance of gait-based biometric systems.

## Key Highlights

### **What is Gait Recognition?**
- Gait refers to the walking pattern of an individual.
- It is a periodic activity, and one complete gait cycle occurs when a foot moves from the front to the back and returns to the front.
- Gait recognition enables:
  - Identification from afar.
  - Non-invasive biometric verification.

### **Applications Beyond Biometrics**
- Besides biometric identification, gait analysis can be applied in:
  - Chiropractic diagnostics.
  - Osteopathic evaluations.

## Proposed Model: Key Features
### **Silhouette Extraction**
- Silhouettes represent the person in solid black or white.
- Traditional methods use frame subtraction techniques for silhouette extraction.
- The **SSFE algorithm** proposed in this study ensures more **efficient silhouette extraction** and **network training**.

### **Gait Parameters**
1. **Dynamic Base**
2. **Step Length**
3. **Cadence**
4. **Stride Length**
5. **Speed**

### **Novel Features for Biometrics**
- Body Width
- Leg Width (Step Length)
- Leg Length
- Body Length

These features are quantified and leveraged for human recognition.
